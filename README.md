# <ins>Project Name</ins> :- RECIEPE FINDER APPLICATION

This HTML code creates the structure for a simple "Recipe Finder" web application with placeholders for interactive elements. Here's an overview of the key parts:

1. **HTML Structure**:
   - **Doctype Declaration**: Specifies the HTML5 document type (`<!DOCTYPE html>`).
   - **HTML Tag and Metadata**: The `<html>` tag with language attribute (`lang="en"`) wraps the entire content. Metadata includes the character set (`UTF-8`) and viewport settings for mobile responsiveness.

2. **Page Title and Stylesheet**:
   - The `<title>` tag sets the page title as "Recipe Finder," and a stylesheet (`style.css`) is linked in the `<head>` section for styling.

3. **App Layout**:
   - **Header**: The `<header>` tag contains the title "Recipe Finder" and a chef hat icon represented by an SVG. This serves as the app's banner.
   - **Main Content Area**: The `<main>` tag with class `main-content` includes:
     - **Search Filters**: A placeholder `<div>` with `id="search-filters"` where search filter options (e.g., ingredient input or dietary preferences) will be added.
     - **Recipes Grid**: Another placeholder `<div>` with `id="recipes-grid"` to display recipe results in a grid layout.

4. **Recipe Modal**:
   - The `<div id="recipe-modal" class="modal hidden">` serves as a modal overlay, initially hidden (`class="hidden"`), which could be used to display detailed recipe information when a recipe is selected.

5. **JavaScript Inclusion**:
   - The `<script src="script.js">` tag includes an external JavaScript file (`script.js`), which will handle functionality, such as fetching recipes, handling search filters, and displaying the recipe modal.

Overall, this code sets up the structural elements of the Recipe Finder application, leaving the interactivity and styling to be managed by separate JavaScript and CSS files.
